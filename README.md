# Cancer-Data-Mining
This project has been submitted for my BSc. CompSci dissertation. Data has not been included, as is of a confidential, medical nature.
This project was created to assist in the classification of bowel cancer patients, using Weka generated models. The project supports Weka outputs in the form of NNGE rules and J48 decision trees and can implement those models to classify data records.

Supports: CSV formatted data. Weka outputted J48 and NNGE models along with a standardised rule-based model. Customisation features via xml config files. Data variable descriptions via XML "translator" files. 

Features: Proof of concept visualization techniques (Minkowski distances between data records and target labels).

Full project details can be found in the accompanying thesis, available upon request or at a later date.
